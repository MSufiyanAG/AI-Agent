# DEPLOY-AI-AGENT Backend â€” Setup & Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy your backend using GitHub, Docker, and Railway, and make it live with a database and environment configuration.

---

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Create a copy of this project in your own GitHub account to customize and deploy.

2. **Connect to Railway**
   - In [Railway](https://railway.app), create or select your project.
   - Link your GitHub repository to the Railway project as the deployment source.

3. **Add a PostgreSQL Database**
   - In your Railway project environment, add a PostgreSQL database plugin.

4. **Set Deployment Settings**
   - Go to your deployment in Railway and open the **Settings**.
   - Set the **root directory** to `DEPLOY-AI-AGENT/backend` (where your Dockerfile is located).

5. **Specify Railway Configuration**
   - Add the path to your Railway configuration file: `DEPLOY-AI-AGENT/backend/railway.json`.

6. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In the **Variables** section:
     - Add `DATABASE_URL` using the connection string from the PostgreSQL database you just created.
     - Add `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` (use an app password for email).
     - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI access.

7. **Deploy**
   - Deploy your backend by pushing any new changes. Railway will build and deploy your project.

8. **Assign a Public Domain**
   - Once deployment is complete, go to **Settings > Networking** in Railway.
   - Click **Generate Domain** and enter the backend port (For us: 8000).

9. **Verify the Deployment**
   - Your backend should now be live with a public URL.
   - Visiting the domain should display a hello message or indicate the backend is running. If a frontend is connected, you should see it communicating with the backend.
  
10. **Scheduled Backend API Access**
    - The backend API is being accessed automatically each day via a scheduled `curl` command, configured in your GitHub Actions workflow.  
    - This ensures your service regularly receives external requests and performs its automation as intended.

For any issues, check your deployment logs and verify environment variables and file paths. Happy coding! ðŸš€
